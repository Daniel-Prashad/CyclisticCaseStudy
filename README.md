# Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Project: Cyclistic Case Study

## Introduction
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company wants to create a marketing strategy aimed to convert their casual users (those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) into annual members, in order to increase revenue. However, in order to create an effective marketing strategy, the marketing team must first understand how casual users and annual members use the Cyclistic service differently. Using the insights gained from this analysis, the marketing team can be better equipped to devise an effective marketing strategy. The analytical approach taken to help solve this business problem is as described below. 

## Analytical Approach
The goal of the analysis is to determine the differences between how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes. The inital hypothesis regarding this difference is that casual riders mostly use Cyclistic bikes for leisure, while annual members are more likely to use them to commute to and from work. The approach to end at this hypothesis is to analyze the differences in each group's relationship to:
  1. Weather
  2. The day of week and time of day
  3. The duration and distance of a ride
